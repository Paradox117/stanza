#### Project Overview  
**STANZA** is a comprehensive **Bookstore Management System**. The primary objective of this project is to develop a fully functional website for managing bookstore operations.  

##### Features  
- **For Customers**:  
  - Browse and explore books available in the store.  
  - Purchase books using personal user accounts.  

- **For Employees (Admin)**:  
  - Access the admin page via admin accounts.  
  - Manage the stock of books in the store (e.g., adding, removing, or updating inventory).  

#### Technology Stack  
- **Backend**: Python with Flask (micro web framework).  
- **Database**: MySQL for managing data.  
- **Frontend**: HTML and CSS for designing the website.  

#### Hardware and Software Requirements  
- **Hardware**:  
  This website is designed to be hosted on any modern computer (or virtual machine) with at least:  
  - 1 GB of RAM.  
  - A single-core 64-bit CPU.  
  - Sufficient storage for the database.  

- **Software**:  
  - **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (cloud server hosting).  
  - **Python Version**: 3.10.  

  **Python Modules Used**:  
  - **Flask**: To run the web server.  
  - **mysql-connector**: Interface with the database.  
  - **Pillow**: Resize and save uploaded images.  
  - **Werkzeug**: Generate safe filenames.  
  - **Bcrypt**: Hash passwords securely.  

- **IDE**:  
  Throughout the development of this project, **Visual Studio Code** was extensively used by all team members.  

#### My Contributions  
I contributed to the backend development of the project, focusing on implementing core Python functionality, without the Flask portion. My responsibilities included:  
- Developing **sales-related functions** to manage transactions and revenue tracking.  
- Implementing **search-related features** to enhance user experience.  
- Managing and maintaining the **database schema** (`bookstore.sql`) to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval, alongside the SQL queries.
